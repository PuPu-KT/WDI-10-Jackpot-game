A jackpot machine built based on HTML/CSS/JS we learnt so far. 
This is 1st project after 2 weeks of immersive course.

<b>Objective - How to Play</b>

A PC with browser is all you need. (The same one you got here with!)
   
Just download the files from either folders & use the HTML file.
 <ul>  
Game's pretty straightforward, enter an amount & start pushing the button!
<li>-- A Pair nets a 2x of your current amount</li>
<li>-- 3 of same nets you 5x.</li>
<li>-- 1 skull & you lose 1 coin</li>
<li>-- 2 skulls , you lose 5 coins</li>
<li>-- A whole row of skulls & you lose EVERYTHING!</li>
