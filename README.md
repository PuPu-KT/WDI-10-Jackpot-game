A jackpot machine built based on HTML/CSS/JS we learnt so far. 
This is 1st project after 2 weeks of immersive course.

   A PC with browser is all you need. (The same one you got here with!)
   
   Just download the files from either folders & use the HTML file.
    
   Game's pretty straightforward, enter an amount & start pushing the button!
   -- A Pair nets a 2x of your current amount
   -- 3 of same nets you 5x.
   -- 1 skull & you lose 1 coin
   -- 2 skulls , you lose 5 coins
   -- A whole row of skulls & you lose EVERYTHING!
